### Important links

I recommend attempting to follow these steps:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) (for a good python installation)
2. [Intro to command line](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/) (may not be 100% necessary depending on your selection in item 3, but it never hurts to have familiarity here
3. Install a suitable code editor. There are a range of options here. [Visual basic](https://code.visualstudio.com) is widely used across programming languages. Folks in my lab use [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org), which I believe is more Python based. I use [vim](https://www.vim.or) which is horribly old fashioned (many would probably say outdated). The professor who recorded lectures in item (4) uses Pycharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), which I attempted to use but felt was cumbersome. Itâ€™s really up to you to choose which one suits you. They all essentially do the same thing - let you write and in some cases run code)
4. Follow these lectures: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcxZNEHclemUgPLYGUkxoUB-Av41wGxpN](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcxZNEHclemUgPLYGUkxoUB-Av41wGxpN) 
5. Complete the accompanying assignments as you go through the lectures.
